This is a [Subframe](https://subframe.com) Next.js Starter Kit that provides just enough configuration to get off and running with Subframe.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

And then run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Learn More

Once running, you can Install Subframe locally by "syncing" Subframe with your Starter Kit. This is achieved by running the Subframe [Sync Command](https://docs.subframe.com/installation)
